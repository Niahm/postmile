# About

Postmile is a collaborative list making tool built using JS, Node.js, and MongoDB.
Postmile is based on the discontinued experimental Yahoo! Sled project initially published at: https://github.com/yahoo/postmile.

# To Do

This project is still being adjusted and does not work yet outside its original environment. The main task right now is to remove the hard-coded sled.com references throughout the project and replace them with a configurable document.

Other tasks include:

 * Make HTTPS optional for local experimentations to make it easier to install and play with
 * Rename the ‘sled’ objects to ‘list’, and get rid of all use of the Sled term
 * Unify the two servers (api, web) to allow them to run inside the same process for single server setup
 * Write an install guide and database setup script
