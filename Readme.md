
# About

Postmile is a collaborative list making tool built using JS, Node.js, and MongoDB.
Postmile is based on the discontinued experimental Yahoo! Sled project initially published at: https://github.com/yahoo/postmile.

# To Do

 * Write an install guide and database setup script
 * Rename the ‘sled’ objects to ‘list’, and get rid of all use of the Sled term
 * Unify the two servers (api, web) to allow them to run inside the same process for single server setup
