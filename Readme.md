# About

This is a raw code dump of the discontinued experimental Yahoo! Sled project - a collaborative list making tool built using JS and Node.js.
For more information about the project and the latest updates go to: https://github.com/hueniverse/postmile.

# To Do

This project is still being concerted and does not work yet outside its original environment. The main task right now is to remove the hard-coded sled.com references throughout the project and replace them with a configurable document.

Other tasks include:

 * Make HTTPS optional for local experimentations to make it easier to install and play with
 * Rename the ‘sled’ objects to ‘list’, and get rid of all use of the Sled term
 * Unify the two servers (api, web) to allow them to run inside the same process for single server setup
 * Write an install guide and database setup script
